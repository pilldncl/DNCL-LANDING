# Git Credentials Setup for DNCL-LANDINGPAGE

## Configuration Summary

This project is configured to automatically use your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for all git operations.

### Configured Settings:

1. **Credential Helper**: Store (credentials saved locally)
2. **Git User**: pilldncl
3. **Git Email**: phuly.dncl@gmail.com
4. **Token**: Configured in credential store

### How It Works:

- Git will automatically use your PAT token stored in `.git-credentials` file
- No need to enter credentials when pushing/pulling
- Token is stored locally in the project's git configuration

### Security Note:

The `.git-credentials` file contains your GitHub token. This file is automatically ignored by git (it's in `.gitignore`), but keep it secure.

### To Verify Setup:

```bash
git push
```

If configured correctly, you should be able to push without entering credentials.

### To Update Token:

If you need to update the token, edit the `.git-credentials` file or run:
```bash
git config --local credential.helper store
# Then perform a git operation that requires auth
```
